# Obertura — roadmap

A personal chess-openings trainer (a focused Lotus-style clone, openings only),
built as an installable PWA. See `CLAUDE.md` for the project guide and the
phase-by-phase build order.

## v1.0 — the working trainer ✅

The first end-to-end version: build lines, save them, train them with spaced
repetition, and look at your games.

- ✅ **Phase 1** — board on the phone (chessground + chess.js + PWA shell)
- ✅ **Phase 2** — repertoire builder: move tree, clickable move list, save to
  IndexedDB, opening names, My Lines screen, branch view, playback
- ✅ **Phase 3** — training + SM-2 spaced repetition: pre-training gate, drill
  loop, wrong-move behaviour, move notes, scheduler, end-of-session summary,
  training on/off per line
- ✅ **Phase 4** — Stockfish 18 lite WASM engine: eval bar + top-moves panel
- ✅ **Phase 5** — plain-language "why this move" explanations, engine-graded
- ✅ **Phase 6** — Chess.com import (Published-Data API) + Progress tab

_Restore point: tag `v1.0`._
